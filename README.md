# Many Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Examples: Terraform, OpenTofu, AWS, Kubernetes, and More

## What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning virtual computing resources like Virtual CPU, Virtual Memorym etc. using machine readable configuration files and avoid any manual processes to manage required virtual computing resources. It's a key DevOps / DevSecOps / GitOps / CNAPP practice to help organizations or individuals manage their infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way.  This repository contains practical examples of IaC implementations across several platforms.

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) examples, templates, and configurations using tools like **Terraform**, **OpenTofu**, **AWS**, **Civo**, **Twingate**, **Kubernetes**, and **Kubectl**. The content is designed to help you automate and manage your cloud infrastructure, networks, containerized applications etc.

This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for developers, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure architects looking to build and deploy IaC solutions across multiple platforms.
